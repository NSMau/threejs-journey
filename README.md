# Three.js Journey

This is an extended exploration of the Bruno Simon's course: [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz/).

I've added some personal touches that helped me to get a better understading of Three.js

- I've reviewed and used approaches and functionality from the [official Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/introduction/Creating-a-scene) and other online resources.

- I used TypeScript and Sass.

- I've also written each lesson in React Three Fiber.
