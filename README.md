# Three.js Journey

This is an extended exploration of the Bruno Simon's course: [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz/).

I complemented the lessons and content from Bruno's course with the [official Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/introduction/Creating-a-scene) as well with content from other sources in order to achieve a solid understanding of Three.js.

The Three.js documentation is heavily quoted and referenced throughout all the articles.
