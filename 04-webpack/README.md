# Three.js Journey

In this lesson, we'll be setting up [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and add our Three.js Scene from [Lesson 3](../03-Basic-Scene/README.md).

## Setup

Run the following commands to get started:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
pnpm dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
pnpm build
```
