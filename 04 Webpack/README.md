# 04 - Webpack

For this lesson, I've set up a custom [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration, since I'll be using TypeScript, Pug, and Sass. Once configured, I've added our Three.js scene from [Lesson 3](../03-Basic-Scene/README.md).

## Setup

Run the following commands to get started:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
pnpm watch

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
pnpm build
```
